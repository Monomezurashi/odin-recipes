TOP Project of a basic HTML site

Basic HTML site that includes recipes
Aim of this project is to stretch HTML coding ability
    as well as using git uploads through the command line

Tips for me:
git status - see current staging area
git add - add files to staging area
git commit -m "" - commit to next push
git push (origin) - push to Github
